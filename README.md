# Universal Updater
Console based unofficial updater for Windows Phone.

The Universal Updater allows you to update a connected Windows Phone device directly or by updating an FFU firmware file and then flashing it to the device. The updated FFU will perform a hard reset on the first boot. You can skip intermediate builds and update directly to higher builds.

### Note
FFU Update use CMD directly to command and update FFU's BCD state,
we do that to ensure OS will perform hard reset on first start.
your Antivirus may complaint or ask for permission, this is very normal behavior
you can safely allow or exclude the app from the detected (if any of that happen)
